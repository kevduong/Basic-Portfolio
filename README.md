**** Instructions ****

IMPORTANT Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots. You'll find the specs for these designs below.

-When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS -- and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:

-If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
-If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
  So on and so forth.

The content for the index.html should be unique to you.

-Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!

-The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is, that is fine and expected.

-Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

After all of your html is written, you can begin styling your pages using the style.css file you created.
-Be sure to validate your html
-Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.
-Push your changes to Github.

** Additional Specifcations **

  Main header background color: #ffffff
  Main header border color: #cccccc

  All other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;

Pro-tip. Use the Page Ruler extension to measure the size of elements

Bonus

Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, image links and buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found here.
You can use Adobe Kuler to find colors that match the theme (In this case, the primary color is Teal #4aaaa5).
Make a 'sticky footer.' You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most honitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
